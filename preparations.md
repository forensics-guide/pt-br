# Preparations

There are many ways to inspect a device and acquire data. There are some initial considerations to make before proceeding. Some of these could be:
Safety: Is it safe for the owner to proceed? What if we get it wrong? Is the owner at significant risk?
Backup: Is there a possibility that the triaging would cause loss of data? Are there backups?
Methodology: Do we think there are opportunities for litigation? If so, is the way we acquire data going to hinder them?
