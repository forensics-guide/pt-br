# Check for Shortcuts

[Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) is a iOS feature that automates system and app functions. It has been used to persistently [launch malware](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/). (It is less likely now since the introduction of mandatory notifications whenever a Shortcut is launched.)

Check for Shortcuts that are unknown by the user.
